    "1.\tWho developed Python Programming language?\n",
    "Ans. Guido van Rossum\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tWhich type of Programming does Python support?\n",
    "Ans. Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. \n",
    "    Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, \n",
    "    and many of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tis python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?\n",
    "Ans. Yes, Python is a case-sensitive language, i.e., it treats uppercase and lowercase characters differently.\n",
    "    This applies to identifiers too.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.\tWhat Is the correct extension of the Python file?\n",
    "Ans. .py\n",
    "\n",
    "5.\tIs Python code compiled or interpreted?\n",
    "Ans. Python is an interpreted language, which means the source code of a Python program is converted into bytecode\n",
    "    that is then executed by the Python virtual machine. Python is different from major compiled languages, \n",
    "    such as C and C + +, as Python code is not required to be built and linked like code for these languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.\tName a few blocks of code used to define In Python language?\n",
    "Ans. Structure of a program. A Python program is constructed from code blocks.\n",
    "    A block is a piece of Python program text that is executed as a unit. \n",
    "    The following are blocks: a module, a function body, and a class definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.\tState a character used to give single-line comments In Python?\n",
    "Ans. We can write a single-line comment by adding a single # character before any statement or line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.\tMention functions which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on?\n",
    "Ans. The function sys.version can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.\tpython supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime using a construct called -------?\n",
    "Ans. It uses a construct called \"lambda\" .\n",
    "\n",
    "10.\tWhat does pip stand for python?\n",
    "Ans. preferred installer program.\n",
    "\n",
    "11.\tMention a few built-In functions In python?\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "    •\tprint( ) function.\n",
    "    •\ttype( ) function.\n",
    "    •\tinput( ) function.\n",
    "    •\tabs( ) function.\n",
    "    •\tpow( ) function.\n",
    "    •\tdir( ) function.\n",
    "    •\tsorted( ) function.\n",
    "    •\tmax( ) function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "12.\twhat is the maximum possible length of an identifier in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. 79 characters\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "13.\tWhat are the benefits of using Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. \t\n",
    "    Data science.\n",
    "    Scientific and mathematical computing.\n",
    "    Web development.\n",
    "    Finance and trading.\n",
    "    System automation and administration.\n",
    "    Computer graphics.\n",
    "    Basic game development.\n",
    "    Security and penetration testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "14.\tHow Is memory managed In Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures.\n",
    "    The management of this private heap is ensured internally by the Python memory manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "15.\thow to install python on windows and set path variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. The complete path of python.exe can be added by:\n",
    "    1.\tRight-clicking This PC and going to Properties.\n",
    "    2.\tClicking on the Advanced system settings in the menu on the left.\n",
    "    3.\tClicking on the Environment Variables button on the bottom right.\n",
    "    4.\tIn the System variables section, selecting the Path variable and clicking on Edit. \n",
    "        The next screen will show all the directories that are currently a part of the PATH variable.\n",
    "    5.\tClicking on New and entering Python’s install directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "16.\tIs Indentation required In python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.\n",
    "    Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, \n",
    "    the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.\n",
